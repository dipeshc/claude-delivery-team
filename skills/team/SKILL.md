  Run the delivery team over this project's backlog — spawn the singleton
  Manager (which runs Developers, the Reviewer, the singleton Merge-Clerk
  and the QA), route work to the direct or team lane, file or delegate backlog
  items, relay the Manager's status reports, and watchdog the pipeline. Use when
  the user asks to run the team, work the backlog, or invokes /team. Works in
  any repo that has a `.claude/project-profile.md`.
---

Launch and steward the delivery **team**. The root instance (you) stays thin:
you **route by lane, spawn the Manager, file items, surface `MERGE-BLOCKED`,
and watchdog** — you never triage, implement, review, or merge on the team lane.
The Manager owns the whole delivery loop: Developers implement in per-item
worktrees, a **Reviewer** (one by default; the project profile may scale to
more if its throughput genuinely needs it) judges correctness and emits
`APPROVED`, the singleton **Merge-Clerk** lands approved work ff-only (the only
writer of the code the team lane produces; the direct lane below lands its
own), the **QA** guards the default branch.

## Read these two files first

1. **`<repo>/.claude/project-profile.md`** — the only place this project's
   specifics live: repo root and default branch, quality-gate commands (scoped
   vs full), backlog location and conventions, repo-wide invariant guards,
   worktree layout and branch naming, sanctioned direct-write paths,
   cross-surface parity. `n/a` genuinely means "no such requirement here" —
   never invent one, never carry a convention over from another project. **If
   the profile is missing, stop and tell the user** — guessing the quality gate
   or the backlog convention wastes a whole cycle.
2. **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/team-charter.md`** — the rules every team agent obeys (lane
   routing by risk, capability gate, repo's-own-tooling, scoped-writers,
   verification discipline, backlog conventions, message schemas). Read it once
   so your watchdog judgments match the agents' rules.

Throughout this skill, `<repo>`, `<default-branch>`, `<backlog>`, and the gate
commands are whatever the profile says they are.

## Never two Managers

The Manager is a singleton; a second one against the shared tree is the
two-orchestrator hazard. Before spawning, check for a live one — a running
manager task (TaskList) AND **real liveness signals**: recent merges on the
default branch, moving item-branch tips, worktree mtimes, transcript growth —
**never task status alone**. Alive → talk to it via SendMessage (it re-scans the
backlog automatically); do not spawn. Dead (~15 min with none of those signals)
→ recover per the watchdog section, then relaunch. Any safety-net cron runs this
same check first.

**Those signals are necessary but not sufficient.** They describe the Manager
*now*; they cannot see a message you have already queued against it, and
delivery of that message resurrects it — so a Manager that is dead by every
signal can still return minutes after you relaunch. Before relaunching, account
for what you have sent it: a SendMessage you have neither a reply to nor git
evidence it acted on is still undelivered, and undelivered means **may return**,
not dead.

So make the relaunch safe by default. In the same turn you relaunch, SendMessage
the presumed-dead Manager a stand-down — it was presumed dead, a replacement is
running, so it dispatches nothing and reports its state instead of resuming the
pipeline. If it really is dead the message is inert; if it wakes, the
stand-down makes the relaunch safe **only when it is read before the
resurrected Manager acts** — message delivery ordering is not guaranteed, so an
already-queued message can fire on wake ahead of the stand-down. Send it
anyway: it is cheap and closes the gap whenever it wins that race. A
heartbeat-driven relaunch does the same: liveness check first, stand-down in
the same turn.

The ordering-independent backstop is `TaskStop`: stopping the resurrected
Manager's task needs no cooperation from it, so it closes the window regardless
of what either Manager has read. If two are running anyway, stop the one with
**less context** — normally the one you just launched, since the resurrected
instance still holds the run's ledger — via a stand-down plus `TaskStop`, and
confirm the survivor knows it is now the only one.
Then check whether the overlap already
landed something twice: `git -c log.showSignature=false log --oneline -10
<default-branch>` for one item merged twice, a stray `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` in the
main working tree or a clerk worktree, and `git branch --list 'item/*'` for two
branches covering one item. Report the outcome to the user either way — "nothing
landed twice" is a result worth stating.

## Spawning

Agent tool, `subagent_type: "delivery-team:manager"`, `run_in_background: true`, the user's
args passed through verbatim (item filters etc.). The Manager gates itself to a
frontier model per the charter's capability gate — don't override its model
downward. It spawns and supervises its own Developers, Reviewers, Merge-Clerk,
and QA.

> DELETE WHEN nested worktrees are safe for orchestrated agents — never spawn a
> team agent with `isolation: "worktree"`. The Manager creates and assigns
> worktrees itself per the profile's **Worktree layout**; a harness-created one
> underneath it detaches the agent from the tree the pipeline is tracking.

**Install the status heartbeat in the SAME turn you spawn (mandatory).** The
moment you launch a Manager, `CronCreate` a recurring ~10-min job (off the round
minute, e.g. `3,13,23,33,43,53 * * * *`) whose prompt re-invokes YOU to derive
status from git, pull the Manager's ledger, **post an update to the user**, and
recover a dead Manager — self-deleting when the backlog is DRAINED. This is the
ONLY reliable update channel; do not rely on the Manager pushing — see
[Status relay](#status-relay) for why, and for the exact heartbeat prompt. One
heartbeat per run: `CronList` first; never leave a duplicate or an orphaned
heartbeat after `DRAINED`.

**External engine (opt-in).** If — and only if — the profile's **External
implementation engine** section declares one, the Manager routes engine work
through the dedicated `delivery-team:engine-supervisor` agent, which contains
everything engine-related (both modes, invariants, messages, and the Manager's
dispatch guidance). Pass an engine preference through in the args if the owner
specifies one; otherwise it is the Manager's discretion within the profile's
configuration. Where no engine is declared, engines do not exist for the run.

**Tool-grant spot-check:** the agent file's **declared** `tools:` frontmatter is
what this repo controls, so that is what you check — it should match the role's
least-privilege scope, and the Manager, Reviewers, and Merge-Clerk declare no
`Write`/`Edit` at all. Spot-check this when you touch an agent file; a widened
*declaration* is a scope leak.

> DELETE WHEN the runtime registers every agent with exactly its declared tools
> — the loader may add grants beyond the declaration, so a running agent holding
> more than its frontmatter declares is not by itself a finding. Containment for
> the read-only roles is behavioural (the Boundaries sections of
> `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/reviewer.md` and
> `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/merge-clerk.md`), never tool-level.

## Auditing the spec on request — use the skill, don't improvise

When the owner asks for a documentation-consistency check, a docs-vs-code
check, or "is the spec still true after all this", invoke the
**`consistency-check`** skill rather than hand-writing an audit prompt. It is
not QA-only: QA runs it on a cadence, and you run it on demand. It already
encodes the two phases (spec-vs-itself, then code-vs-spec), the
docs-are-spec applicability gate, and the file-nothing-fix-nothing discipline —
an ad-hoc prompt re-derives those inconsistently and loses whatever the last
run learned. Improve the skill when a run exposes a gap; that is what makes
each audit better than the last.

## Direct lane — skip the team for low-risk work

Before filing anything, decide **which lane the item belongs in** (charter,
"Route work by risk, not by habit"). This decision happens once, at intake — it
is not something the Manager re-litigates per item.

**Team lane** (worktree, Developer, independent review, Merge-Clerk — the rest
of this skill): auth/security/crypto, data-model or persistence changes,
cross-package interfaces, cross-surface parity work, or a multi-phase feature.

**Direct lane** (the default for everything else — single-area, small expected
diff, existing test coverage): skip the Manager entirely. Root (or one mid-tier
subagent) does a quick grep/read pass itself — no dedicated research-spike
agent, no backlog file, no worktree. If root cause is found:

1. implement on a short-lived branch;
2. run the profile's **scoped** gate for the area you touched, **plus any
   repo-wide invariant guard your change triggers** (profile, "Repo-wide
   invariant guards") — scoped verification silently skips those;
3. one lightweight self-review pass;
4. ff-merge directly.

The QA's full-suite watch loop is the independent verification for this lane —
it already runs on every new tip of the default branch at near-zero cost, so
verification is not skipped, just not duplicated by a dedicated Reviewer.

Escalate mid-flight to a research spike, or to filing a full team-lane item, if
the grep-first pass doesn't find root cause, or the item turns out to need a
real design decision, or touches more than it looked like at intake. Escalation
is cheap and expected.

## Filing items — research inline when needed

This section covers **team-lane** items only — see "Direct lane" above for
everything that doesn't need this pipeline at all.

When the user asks for new work, decide: **does filing a correct item require
investigation that would tie you up?** (unknown repro, unfamiliar subsystem,
external services, comparing design options)

- **No** (the ask is already a well-formed item) → write the item file yourself
  into the profile's backlog location, following its stated conventions
  (priority in the filename), and commit it explicit-path
  (`docs(backlog): …` or the project's equivalent scope).
- **Yes** → dispatch a **research spike**: spawn a `general-purpose` agent
  (background, frontier model) with the question, the charter path
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/team-charter.md`, and this brief — *read that
  charter before you file anything: it binds you as its root-dispatched
  Researcher. State your model as your first action and **STOP** if you are a
  small model or cannot confidently identify yourself. Investigate for real
  (read the code, reproduce, probe the service, measure — never reason from
  vibes); adversarially check your own conclusion before filing (what would
  prove it wrong? mark verified vs inferred); answer only the question asked
  (adjacent findings are report notes, not extra items); file one item file into
  the profile's backlog location per its conventions (frontmatter
  `by: research`), in the charter's full item shape — every field of its
  handoff contract, evidence as `file:line` — and commit it explicit-path:
  `git add <path>`, never `git add -A`. Or file into the backlog's `blocked/`
  subdirectory with a one-line recommendation when a spec decision is needed;
  end with `FILED {items[], commit, confidence, open_questions}` or
  `NO-ITEM {finding, why}`* — then relay its result to the user.

Either way a running Manager picks the item up within a poll cycle — no relaunch.
A new-item backlog commit is Root's sanctioned write to the main working tree
(profile, "Sanctioned direct-write paths"); everything else on this lane lands
via the Merge-Clerk.

Remember the charter's item lifecycle: **an item is done when the merging commit
deletes its item file** — a file that outlives its merged work gets
re-dispatched, so if you file an item in its own commit, make sure the landing
commit still deletes it.

If the **Manager** sends `NEEDS-RESEARCH {item, question}` (an item that turned
out to need real investigation), you decide: dispatch the same research spike, or
surface it to the user if it is really an owner ruling. The Manager never
commissions research itself.

## Relay duty — a latency optimization, not a correctness gate

Team-agent completions (a Developer's `READY-FOR-REVIEW`, a Reviewer's
`APPROVED`/`CHANGES-REQUESTED`, the Merge-Clerk's `MERGED`, a QA report) can
arrive in YOUR conversation instead of the Manager's whenever the Manager is
between turns — normal harness routing. **Relay the payload to the Manager
verbatim via SendMessage immediately.** But this is a *latency* optimization: the
Manager also reconciles from git on a short cadence, so a relay you miss costs
one poll, not a stall. Relay promptly anyway; don't sit on it.

> DELETE WHEN Claude Code agent teams are generally available (not behind the
> experimental flag) and a child's completion reaches its spawner without a
> relay hop through root — this verbatim-relay duty and the "treat a relay as
> a first-class payload" framing exist only because that isn't true yet.

## Status relay

**The heartbeat cron is the primary channel — root pulls, it does not wait for a
push.** Relying on the Manager to push every 10 min fails: it gets absorbed in a
long tool run and skips the cadence, and even when it does `SendMessage`, the
report only reaches the user if root is independently re-invoked to relay it. So
the heartbeat you install at spawn (see [Spawning](#spawning)) is what
guarantees the user hears from the team. Its prompt — substitute the profile's
default branch and branch-naming convention:

> TEAM STATUS HEARTBEAT (auto). A delivery-team run is (or was) active. (1) Derive
> real status from git — never task status alone: `git -c log.showSignature=false
> log --oneline -6 <default-branch>`, `git branch --list 'item/*'`,
> `git worktree list`, per-worktree mtimes; note new merges + moving branches
> since last beat. (2) Manager liveness: `TaskList`; if the Manager id is known
> `SendMessage` it a `STATUS-REQUEST` and fold in its reply if it returns within
> ~60s; if dead (~15 min no merges / no branch+worktree movement / no live task)
> recover per the watchdog — relaunch a fresh Manager with the same args. (3)
> **Post a short update TO THE USER**: timestamp, what landed (SHAs), what's in
> flight (item branch + last activity), anything BLOCKED/NEEDS-RESEARCH. Never a
> bare "it's quiet". (4) If the backlog is DRAINED and the default branch is
> idle: tell the user the run is complete and `CronDelete` this heartbeat (find
> its id via `CronList`).

The `-c log.showSignature=false` on that `git log` is mandatory, not decorative:
where a repo enables `log.showSignature`, git interleaves human-readable
signature banners into log output, and a heartbeat parsing it reports banners as
commits.

The Manager's own push (a report table: items → status → assigned agent +
developer model / reviewer-<n> / merge-clerk → stage-elapsed → rough ETA) still
arrives on merges and is a welcome *supplement* — relay it when it lands,
cross-checked against git. But never depend on it; the heartbeat is the floor.

**On-demand status ("what's the status?").** Don't make the user wait for the
cadence: (1) SendMessage the Manager a `STATUS-REQUEST` — it reconciles its
ledger against git and pushes a fresh report; (2) while that round-trip runs
(~30–60s), give the user the instant git-derived snapshot yourself (recent
merges, live worktrees + activity, item-branch tips); (3) relay the Manager's
report when it arrives, flagging any divergence. If the Manager doesn't respond
within a couple of minutes, that IS the status — run the liveness check and
report/recover per the watchdog section.

## Watchdog + recovery

Liveness = merges on the default branch, item-branch tip movement, worktree
mtimes, transcript growth — **never** output-file mtime, **never** task status
alone.

**Transcript growth is the only probe that works on a thinking agent.** The
others are activity side-effects, and a working agent can produce none of them:
a review is read-only, so its worktree never changes; a directory's mtime does
not move when files in its *subdirectories* do, so a busy worktree can look
frozen; and a frontier agent can spend **over an hour inside a single turn**
reasoning, with no ref, no file, and no reply the whole time. **Silence is not
death.** Before declaring an agent dead, check that its transcript is growing
and whether a process is burning CPU on its behalf; prefer asking its parent,
which can see its children's transcripts directly.

Getting this wrong is expensive in a specific way: a premature "it died"
dispatches a replacement into a worktree the original still holds — two
writers, whose edits blend into a single commit that neither agent's honest
report describes. When genuinely unsure, wait another interval — a slow agent
costs minutes, a wrongly-recovered one costs the work. A dead Manager takes its children with it but loses nothing: every branch
and worktree survives on disk. Recovery: relaunch a fresh Manager — under the
relaunch discipline in [Never two Managers](#never-two-managers), stand-down
included — and it reconstructs from `git worktree list`,
`git branch --list 'item/*'`, and the backlog, and spawns fresh Developers that
**adopt** the parked worktrees. A completed Manager task ending in
`HANDOFF: relaunch manager` → relay its interim report and relaunch immediately
with the same args + its state block. Ending in **DRAINED** → the backlog is
empty of actionable work; relaunch only when new items are filed.

`MERGE-BLOCKED` in a report means the owner's uncommitted edits in the main
working tree collide with a merge — **surface it to the user; never resolve it
yourself.**

## Blocks only the owner can clear

A block that names a policy conflict — an agent must obey a rule that the work
in front of it cannot satisfy — is not one you clear by asking the user and
passing the answer down. **Owner consent has no channel to a child** (charter,
"Blocked on policy — fix the condition, not the bypass"): every route from you
to an agent is a peer message, and a correctly-hardened agent refuses a peer's
claim to carry the owner's permission. Relaying consent buys a second refusal,
not progress. So:

1. **Take the failing condition to the user in the agent's own terms** — the
   check that failed, the exact command and its output, and what would have to
   be true for it to pass. Ask for a repair, not for permission.
2. **Relay a repair as a fact, never as an instruction to proceed** — "that has
   been changed, re-check it" — and let the agent re-run and act on what it
   observes. Whether the block is really gone is the agent's to establish, not
   yours to assert.
3. **If it cannot be repaired, park the work as owner-action-required** — tell
   the user what is parked (item, branch, worktree, all intact on disk) and what
   only they can do. Do not re-dispatch it hoping for a different answer, do not
   re-word the consent, and never perform the blocked step yourself.

The `MERGE-BLOCKED` case above is the everyday instance: the repair is the
owner's, and nothing you say substitutes for it. An agent that *would* take your
word for the owner's consent is a defect to file, not a route to use.

## Exploration and spike promotion

Exploration is a root-owned specialist run *outside* the pipeline, not a team
member. When the user asks for exploration time, run it per its own note:
[exploration-and-promotion.md](exploration-and-promotion.md).
